# 07. AWS IAM

# 1. IAM

---

1) IAM: Users & Groups

---

1. IAM = Identity and Access Management, Global Service. NOT Regional Services.
2. Root Account created by default, shouldn't be used or shared.
3. Users are people within your organization, and can be grouped.
4. Groups only contain users, not other groups.
5. Users don't have to belong to a group, and user can belong to multiple groups.

2) IAM: Permissions

---

1. Users or Groups can be assigned JSON documents called policies.
2. These policies define the permissions of the users. (Security issues and so on)
3. In AWS you apply the least privilege principle: don't give more permissions than a user needs.

4) IAM MFA Overview

---

1. IAM Password Policy
    1. Strong PW: higher security for your account
    2. In AWS, you can setup a password policy:
        - Set a minimum password length
        - Require specific character types:
            - including uppercase letters
            - lowercase letters
            - numbers
            - non-alphanumeric characters
        - Allow all IAM users to change their own passwords
        - Require users to change their password after some time (password expiration)
        - Prevent password re-use
2. MFA (Multi Factor Authentication)
    1. Users have access to your account and can possibly change configurations or delete resources in your AWS Account
    2. You want to protect your ROOT ACCOUNTS and IAM USERS
    3. MFA = password you know + security device you own
    4. imagine if you log in your mobile bank account, you need your bank # + Password + phone call from the bank.
    5. In AWS, Virtual MFA Device(Phone, Multi-device) → support for multiple tokens on a single device
    6. U2F (YubiKey) → Support for multiple root and IAM users using a single security key
    7. Hardware Key Fob MFA Device, AWS GovCloud

5) AWS Access keys, CLI and SDK

---

1. To access AWS, you have three options:
    1. AWS Management Console (Protected by Password + MFA)
    2. AWS Command Line Instance (CLI) : Protected by access key
    3. AWS Software Developer Kit (SDK)- for code: protected by access key
2. Access keys are generated through the AWS Console
3. Users manage their own access keys.
4. Access Keys are secret, just like a password. DON'T SHARE THEM.
5. Example of AccessKey ID & PW
    1. ID: AENFIENFISNDF
    2. PW: DNFKSDIDINF
6. What is the AWS CLI?
    1. A tool that enables you to interact with AWS services using commands in your command-line shell.
    2. Direct access to the public APIs of AWS services.
    3. You can develop scripts to manage your resources.
    4. It's open-source.
7. What is the AWS SDK?
    1. AWS Software Development Kit (AWS SDK)
    2. Language-Specific APIs (set of libraries)
    3. Enables you to access and manage AWS services programmatically.
    4. Support many devices, programming language, etc.
8. YOU CAN COMMAND FROM AWS CLOUDSHELL in your management console.

6) AWS IAM Roles for Services

---

1. Some AWS Services will need to perform actions on your behalf.
2. To do so, we will assign permissions to AWS services with IAM Roles.
3. Common roles:
    1. EC2 Instance Roles
    2. Lambda Function Roles
    3. Roles for CloudFormation

7) IAM Security Tools

---

1. IAM Credentials Report (account-level)
    - A Report that lists all your account's users and the status of their various credentials.
2. IAM Access Advisor (User-Level)
    - Access advisor shows the service permissions granted to a user and when those services were last accessed.
    - You can use this info. to revise your policies.

8) IAM Guidelines & Best Practices

---

1. Don't use the root account except for AWS account setup
2. One physical user = One AWS user.
3. Assign users to groups and assign permissions to groups.
4. Create a strong password policy
5. MFA!
6. Create and use roles for giving permissions to AWS services.
7. Use Access Keys for programmatic Access (CLI / SDK)

9) Shared Responsibility Model for IAM

10) Summary

---

1. Users: mapped to a physical user, has a password for AWS Console.
2. Groups: contains users only.
3. Policies: JSON document that outlines permission for users or groups.
4. Roles: for EC2 instances or AWS services
5. Security: MFA + Password Policy.

11) Reference

---

1. IAM Credentials report lists all your account's users and the status of their various credentials. The other IAM Security Tool is IAM Access Advisor. It shows the Service permissions granted to a user and when those services were last accessed.
2. IAM policy is an entity that, when attached to an identity or resource, defines their permissions.
3. Customers are responsible for defining and using IAM policies.
4. The AWS CLI can interact with AWS using commands in your command-line shell, while the AWS SDK can interact with AWS programmatically.
5. GRANT LEAST PRIVILEGE
6. You want to enable MFA in order to add a layer of security, so even if your password is stolen, lost or hacked your account is not compromised.
